# Hacker-statistics-and-probabilistic-thinking
I started this notebook in order to go over some concepts on hacker statistics in Python based on 2 Datacamp courses. These concepts are not covered by the Neoland academy and I think they provide a very useful set of tools to any analyst or data scientist, so I also try to explain some concepts and interpret the simulations and the p values.

Hope you find it useful.
